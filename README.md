This is a new generation social application. We focus on social activities in real world and extend them onto the internet. You can either create a event or find an event to join.

###1. create an event

We simplify the whole process of holding an events. Users can select the time, location and decide people to invite. We make it easier for event holder to manage their event in following ways:

* easier to notify invitees of the time and location change
* easier to confirm the availability of invitees

###2. find an event

We show all the available events on the map and users can toggle to select time interval and different events will be shown.

To join one event, user can select a pin on the map and opt join. The holder of the event will get a notification and choose whether to confirm the request.

Besides of map, users can also use list view to find the event they want, it is equivalent to map search.
